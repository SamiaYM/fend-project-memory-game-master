## Description:
	The game start with newGame function. It make sure that every thing is:
		1) zero like, time and move count,  
		2) empty like array that hold two card to check if it is match or not.

	After that start shuffling the pictures and make sure the card is close. Then the game is ready to respond to click. I store two click in array to do the next step which it is comparing.
